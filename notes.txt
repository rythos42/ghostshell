UI
- sort by unfiltered
- colors for accordians?
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- tooltip on disabled equip button
- show categories for shells
- consider a better UI to show sockets/location/equipped/categories

Feature
- highlight shells with uncategorized sockets

Refactor
- see about using dispatch and state less in *Managers
- now that equip and transfer code are in modules, definitely room to make well named functions from code inside them
- function that transfers to vault
- function that handles updating location
- don't know if GhostModTypes is still a model -- just contains enum information
- getItemsFromBucket can probably be done with an array filter instead

Bugs
- Don't show "sign in to see" if the loading bar is showing
- New error when trying to equip a shell for transfer --
    {"Response":0,"ErrorCode":1638,"ThrottleSeconds":0,"ErrorStatus":"DestinyItemFailedLevelCheck","Message":"Your level isn't high enough to use this item.","MessageData":{}}
- Location message not updated properly. STR:
    1. Equip from inventory
    2. Equip from vault
    3. Equip from other guardian
    4. Equip from other guardians equipped
    Actual: Somewhere in those steps one of the shells was said to be in the wrong spot :(

Ops
- travisCI deployment -- there's a timeout that is causing it not to work
- update readme
- destinymanifest.json needs some cache management for when it is refreshed
