- if equip fails because the user isn't in the right spot, do a transfer to inventory instead and report that
- "equip from other guardian"
    - "transfer to me"?
        - "transfer to guardian" then "transfer from vault"?
    - "equip"

Bugs
- filter checkboxes don't appear to come back later
    I used it to do Crucible, then after it was filtered on Crucible but Crucible wasn't selected
- check for a race condition on loading gender/race/class and using it in the refresh


Future
- better way to denote which one is equipped on which character
- need a new favicon
- destinymanifest.json needs some cache management for when it is refreshed
- travisCI deployment -- there's a timeout that is causing it not to work
- update readme
- tooltip isn't great on mobile -- have to long press for 0
- colors for accordians?
- do a proper regex in GhostModTypes.js
- maybe a little UI around the ghost icon with icons that can be hovered over to say where (Vault, Warlock, etc) and tooltips for the sockets and the categories
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- tooltip on disabled equip button
- highlight shells with uncategorized sockets
- something about confidential clients getting refresh tokens? how can I do that?
- put character state into a character model
- see if I need to separate "get access token" and "refresh shell data"
