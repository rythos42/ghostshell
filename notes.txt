UI
- sort by unfiltered
- colors for accordians?
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- tooltip on disabled equip button
- show categories for shells
- consider a better UI to show sockets/location/equipped/categories

Feature
- highlight shells with uncategorized sockets

Refactor
- ghostShell.location is either a characterId or 'vault', should be named better?
- ghostShell should have a membershipType on it as well for in TransferManager.transferTo and EquipManager.equipTo
- TransferManager and EquipManager should use dispatch and state less
- now that equip and transfer code are in modules, definitely room to make well named functions from code inside them
- probably should have a function that transfers to vault
- should have another function that handles updating location
- shell refresh should be in a manager
- put "getByHash" into a file that can be imported

Bugs
- filter checkboxes don't appear to come back later
    I used it to do Crucible, then after it was filtered on Crucible but Crucible wasn't selected
- system doesn't at all work if you have an account on PC and XBox -- overwrites last account


Ops
- travisCI deployment -- there's a timeout that is causing it not to work
- update readme
- destinymanifest.json needs some cache management for when it is refreshed
- remove unused portions of destinymanifest.json to reduce download size
- create a config file for deployment so I don't have to type in the username and password every time
