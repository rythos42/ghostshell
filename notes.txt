UI
- sort by unfiltered
- colors for accordians?
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- tooltip on disabled equip button
- show categories for shells
- consider a better UI to show sockets/location/equipped/categories

Feature
- highlight shells with uncategorized sockets

Refactor
- ghostShell.location is either a characterId or 'vault', should be named better?
- ghostShell should have a membershipType on it as well for in TransferManager.transferTo and EquipManager.equipTo
- see about using dispatch and state less in *Managers
- now that equip and transfer code are in modules, definitely room to make well named functions from code inside them
- function that transfers to vault
- function that handles updating location
- character.locationString is a 'description'
- don't know if GhostModTypes is still a model -- just contains enum information

Bugs
- filter checkboxes don't appear to come back later
    I used it to do Crucible, then after it was filtered on Crucible but Crucible wasn't selected

Ops
- travisCI deployment -- there's a timeout that is causing it not to work
- update readme
- destinymanifest.json needs some cache management for when it is refreshed
- create a config file for deployment so I don't have to type in the username and password every time
