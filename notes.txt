not a tooltip on mobile -- footer to hold the same information on click

UI
- tooltip isn't great on mobile -- have to long press for 0
- colors for accordians?
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- tooltip on disabled equip button
- show categories for shells
- consider a better UI to show sockets/location/equipped/categories

Feature
- Guardian to Guardian transfer is super complicated
    - if it's equipped on the other guardian -- then equip any other non-desired shell
    - transfer desired shell to vault
    - transfer desired shell to desired guardian
    - equip desired shell
- highlight shells with uncategorized sockets

Refactor
- put character state into a character model
- see if I need to separate "get access token" and "refresh shell data"

Bugs
- filter checkboxes don't appear to come back later
    I used it to do Crucible, then after it was filtered on Crucible but Crucible wasn't selected

Ops
- travisCI deployment -- there's a timeout that is causing it not to work
- update readme
- destinymanifest.json needs some cache management for when it is refreshed
- remove unused portions of destinymanifest.json to reduce download size
- create a config file for deployment so I don't have to type in the username and password every time
