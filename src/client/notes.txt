- find Vault shells
- find Warlock shells
- UI to filter by "what" and "regular where" -- maybe filter buttons as I wanted?

Persistence
    - don't need to store accesstoken - we aren't using it multiple times
    - "refresh" will get a new one
    - should make an icon for users who haven't been before and a different icon for returning users ("refresh")
    - store whether a user is returning or not in localStorage

UI
    - disable filters if not signed in
    - labels on input fields in drawers
    - make Sign in button pretty
    - allow table to expand to a certain degree
    - mobile friendly
    - make table cells nice
    - overlay should be exactly the size of the icon/border stuff





Future
- getGhostShellsForCurrentUser is huge and needs refactoring badly
- be able to equip and show which one is currently equipped
- get rid of the spaces at the front of GhostModTypes::GhostModTypeMappings and do a proper regex
- better ACAO
- see about removing "select" action on Service -- it's too wide, even though it's not secret information
- there's a good chance there's a race condition between getAllGhostModTypes and getMutuallyExclusiveWhereList
    - likely Saga can fix this
- getMutuallyExclusiveWhereList called twice
- "TangledShore" in drop down isn't right
- standardize on CSS modules, I like them more than withStyles
- maybe a little UI around the ghost icon with icons that can be hovered over to say where (Vault, Warlock, etc) and tooltips for the sockets and the categories
