- be able to equip and show which one is currently equipped
    - can't equip items not in your inventory
        - have to move them to your inventory THEN equip them...
    - need to make sure there is space there first
    - DIM has some weird code when transferring Guardian-to-Guardian that goes to the vault first that I'm not sure about

- filter checkboxes don't appear to come back later
    I used it to do Crucible, then after it was filtered on Crucible but Crucible wasn't selected
    

Future
- travisCI deployment -- there's a timeout that is causing it not to work
- update readme
- tooltip isn't great on mobile -- have to long press for 0
- colors for accordians?
- getGhostShellsForCurrentUser is huge and needs refactoring badly
    - vault section in particular is has a ton of loops in it
    - collate some of the calls being made
    - that login is NOT fast
- get rid of the spaces at the front of GhostModTypes::GhostModTypeMappings and do a proper regex
- better ACAO
- see about removing "select" action on Service -- it's too wide, even though it's not secret information
- maybe a little UI around the ghost icon with icons that can be hovered over to say where (Vault, Warlock, etc) and tooltips for the sockets and the categories
- don't think I need to unzip the manifestDb in order to read the filename -- can get it from the /manifest call
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- tooltip on disabled equip button
- have Service return only data I'm actually using
- highlight shells with uncategorized sockets
- something about confidential clients getting refresh tokens? how can I do that?
