- instead of checking access token expiry, check what result we get when it doesn't work and report that
    - it gives a 401 if no access token
- if equip fails because the user isn't in the right spot, do a transfer to inventory instead and report that
- "transfer from vault" involves checking how much inventory space user has (the last time we checked)
    - if <9 shells, a-ok
    - if 9 shells, transfer something TO vault first
    - if it fails, report and move on
- "equip from vault" 
    - "transfer from vault"
    - "equip"
- "equip from other guardian"
    - "transfer to me"?
        - "transfer to guardian" then "transfer from vault"?
    - "equip"
- separate "get access token" and "refresh shell data"
- make "refresh shell data" faster then see if we need to separate "get access token" and "refresh"


- filter checkboxes don't appear to come back later
    I used it to do Crucible, then after it was filtered on Crucible but Crucible wasn't selected
- consider downloading the manifest content I need into a JSON file and loading that locally, rather than the PHP server




Future
- travisCI deployment -- there's a timeout that is causing it not to work
- update readme
- tooltip isn't great on mobile -- have to long press for 0
- colors for accordians?
- getGhostShellsForCurrentUser is huge and needs refactoring badly
    - vault section in particular is has a ton of loops in it
    - collate some of the calls being made
    - that login is NOT fast
- get rid of the spaces at the front of GhostModTypes::GhostModTypeMappings and do a proper regex
- better ACAO
- see about removing "select" action on Service -- it's too wide, even though it's not secret information
- maybe a little UI around the ghost icon with icons that can be hovered over to say where (Vault, Warlock, etc) and tooltips for the sockets and the categories
- don't think I need to unzip the manifestDb in order to read the filename -- can get it from the /manifest call
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- tooltip on disabled equip button
- have Service return only data I'm actually using
- highlight shells with uncategorized sockets
- something about confidential clients getting refresh tokens? how can I do that?
