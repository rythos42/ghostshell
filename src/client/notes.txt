- buttons to sort Ghosts by sockets
    - because of the number of socktes, can't do filter buttons like I wanted
    - drop down for "where" for sure
    - maybe I can have buttons for "what" still
    - need a UI that can select multiple things, maybe someone wants a shell that is for Io and Public Events and telemetry??
        - maybe a drawer?
- get ghosts for different characters on account
    - drop down list to select characters
- getOAuthToken is no longer correctly named and is huge and needs refactoring badly
- find Vault shells

UI
    - make Sign in button pretty
    - allow table to expand to a certain degree
    - mobile friendly
    - make table cells nice


Future
- be able to equip and show which one is currently equipped
- get rid of the spaces at the front of GhostModTypes::GhostModTypeMappings and do a proper regex
- better ACAO
- see about removing "select" action on Service -- it's too wide, even though it's not secret information
