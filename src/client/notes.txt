- be able to equip and show which one is currently equipped
    - and select which character to equip it to
- travisCI automatic deployment
    - I'm sure it can do a yarn build for me and ftp the contents up


Future
- update readme
- tooltip isn't great on mobile -- have to long press for 0
- colors for accordians?
- rounded corners on icons or icon containers
- getGhostShellsForCurrentUser is huge and needs refactoring badly
    - vault section in particular is has a ton of loops in it
    - collate some of the calls being made
    - that login is NOT fast
- get rid of the spaces at the front of GhostModTypes::GhostModTypeMappings and do a proper regex
- better ACAO
- see about removing "select" action on Service -- it's too wide, even though it's not secret information
- maybe a little UI around the ghost icon with icons that can be hovered over to say where (Vault, Warlock, etc) and tooltips for the sockets and the categories
- don't think I need to unzip the manifestDb in order to read the filename -- can get it from the /manifest call
- can't hover over overlayed cells to see stats
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- have Service return only data I'm actually using
- highlight shells with uncategorized sockets
