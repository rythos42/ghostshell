- basename still not working
- UI to filter by "what" and "regular where" -- maybe filter buttons as I wanted?
- that getGhostShells vault section is ungodly


Future
- colors for accordians
- rounded corners on icons or icon containers
- getGhostShellsForCurrentUser is huge and needs refactoring badly
- be able to equip and show which one is currently equipped
    - and select which character to equip it to
- get rid of the spaces at the front of GhostModTypes::GhostModTypeMappings and do a proper regex
- better ACAO
- see about removing "select" action on Service -- it's too wide, even though it's not secret information
- "TangledShore" in drop down isn't right
- maybe a little UI around the ghost icon with icons that can be hovered over to say where (Vault, Warlock, etc) and tooltips for the sockets and the categories
- remove Redux-Saga after I'm convinced I don't need it.
- don't think I need to unzip the manifestDb in order to read the filename -- can get it from the /manifest call
- collate some of the calls being made
- can't hover over overlayed cells to see stats
- consider storing ghostshells in localStorage as well so refresh is literally just that
- tooltip over disabled filters
- tooltip on refresh button
- helper function to create a config object -- creating it in two places
- have Service return only data I'm actually using
