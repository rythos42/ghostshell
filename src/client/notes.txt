- why only 2 perks on Bursting Wisdom Shell in app? There are actually 3...
- buttons to sort Ghosts by perks
- get ghosts for different characters on account
- getOAuthToken is no longer correctly named and is huge and needs refactoring badly
- find Vault shells

UI
    - make Sign in button pretty
    - allow table to expand to a certain degree


Future
- be able to equip and show which one is currently equipped
- get rid of the spaces at the front of GhostModTypes::GhostModTypeMappings and do a proper regex
- better ACAO
- see about removing "select" action on Service -- it's too wide, even though it's not secret information
